# Project 3

## Global Retirement Solutions

### Description

This project consists of creative retirement solutions and uses API requests along with React and Mongo database. The user signs in and inputs specific details into the input fields, then clicks "submit". Then the Numbeo API pulls information pertaining to 10 specific cities and JQuery/Javascript code computes retirement results based on data points of Social Security/Pension, 401k/IRA retirement assets, and desired retirement Age compared to a life expectancy estimate of 80. The results indicates to the user the total amount of funds currently needed to retire in a specific location. The information is also saved to the Mongo database.

The app also includes a link to a government site with comprehensive advice and resources for US Citizens planning to retire abroad.
